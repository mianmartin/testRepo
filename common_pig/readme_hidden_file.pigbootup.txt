For  Pig 0.11.x we are using .pigbootup file  to define the common register define and set statements.

Location of the file .pigbootup is configurable
Location of .pigbootup is configurable via the property “pig.load.default.statements”,  adding  an entry to pig.properties to point to an alternate location
